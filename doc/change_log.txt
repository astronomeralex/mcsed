VERSION NOTES:
- 1.4c:
	All bands have central wavelength below 1250 Angstrom rest frame
	are set to zero flux.  This only considers the central wavelength
	of the bands and does not account for the fact that the transmission
	curve for a band extends over a finite width in wavelength, e.g.
	the lower wavelength parts of some bands may consider emission 
	below 1250 rest frame.

	Unrelated, but also added a check in the outputs folder to see if 
	an outputN.npz exists for that N.  Allows code to be run twice
	if the first run didn't get through all objects before LionXG said
	time was up.
	
	
- 1.3c:
	Eb (uvb) can now be negative. required changing the FSPS code by 
	commenting out some lines in the beginning of add_dust.f90 that 
	didn't allow for negative uvb. It now ranges from [-2,5]
	
- 1.2c:
	added superIndexes: a smart way to split up the rows of outputFluxes 
	that do not have all 0's.  Each of the N main.py's running takes an 
	equal number of these.

- 1.1c:
	moved the function that handles errors to math_functions.py.  main.py
	now simply calls this function.  this function has also been updated
	to, for each given band, allow the error to be the max of err_floor,
	the actual error for the band, and the half the contribution of OIII, 
	H_beta, OII, and, H_alpha, if a line falls in that band.  also, removed
	the requirement at an object needs at least two observations to do a 
	random walk because added the requirement that there is at least 3
	observations less than 10000, two between 10000 and 25000 and one over
	30000 (observed frame)

- 1.0c:
    because sfh = 1 doesnt interpolate properly between Conroy's tage points,
    a work around has been implimented into emcee_functions.lnprob().  It gets
    the SEDs of the nearest two tage points and creates its own interpolation
    function between them.  This will increase run time by atleast 2x because
    two SEDs are created per lnprob() call versus the previous amount of one.
